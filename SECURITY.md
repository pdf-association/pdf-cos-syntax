# Security

As an industry association and standards development organization (SDO), the PDF Association recognizes application security as critical to users' trust. Secure and robust implementation of PDF software is a matter for each software implementor. Any discovered security vulnerabilities should be responsibly reported directly to the vendor or implementor on a case-by-case basis.

On this basis the PDF Association strongly encourages [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/SpecialReport/2017_003_001_503340.pdf).

This repository uses Github security alerts and addresses issues as they are reported.
